This is my implementation of Checkers. Hopefully it works! (-:

# 06-Checkers

Let's play a game of checkers! This is the fifth programming assignment for ILS-Z399. The requirements for this assignment are as follows:

* Beginning with a functioning game of checkers, write a simple AI to play on behalf of the black pieces
* Choose whatever strategy you would like; I will give more points for more sophisticated (or effective) solutions
* You should be able to restrict your changes to AI.py, but you may need to look in Board.py and checkers.py to see how I implemented the other features of the game
* Checkers takes place on an alternating 8x8 board, where each player uses eight colored pieces to move across the board, capturing their opponents
* The rules of the game can be found [here](http://www.darkfish.com/checkers/rules.html)

To get a perfect score, you will need to think creatively! Think about ways you can make this project more interesting or fun.

To complete this assignment you will need to understand:

* Python Classes, objects, and other data structures
* How to think logically
